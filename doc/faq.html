<h2><a name="TYPES"></a>Is XMLPULL V1 API compatible with XML 1.0?</h2>

<P>

If <a href="http://xmlpull.org/v1/doc/features.html#process-docdecl">PROCESS DOCDECL
</a>is set to true then XMLPULL implementation is conforming to XML 1.0. However 
this feature is set by default to false and it must be explicitly turned on. If 
input XML documents has no DTD declaration then parser behavior is identical 
independent of the value of the feature <a href="http://xmlpull.org/v1/doc/features.html#process-docdecl">PROCESS DOCDECL</a>. 

<P>

The feature is by default false to allow creation of very small XMLPULL 
implementations intended to work in J2ME environments. 









<h2><a name="SAX2"></a>What is the relation between SAX2 and XMLPULL API?</h2>

<P>

SAX2 defines how to do XML <b>push parsing</b> and is very well doing when one 
needs to process only parts of XML input (for example when filtering XML). 
XMLPULL API is designed to allow fast and efficient XML <b>pull parsing</b> that 
is performing best in situation when whole XML input must be processed and 
transformed (for example SOAP deserialization). 

<P>

It is important to notice that those two APIs are not overlapping but instead 
they supplement each other. In the matter of fact it is possible to convert 
easily pull to push (a <a href="#SAX2_DRIVER">SAX2 driver</a> built on top of 
XMLPULL is available) but opposite conversion is more difficult and will require 
either buffering all SAX events (and making streaming impossible) or extra 
thread that is used to request more events to be pushed by push SAX callbacks 
(this is explained in more details in
<a href="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/papers/xml_push_pull/">technical 
report</a> that compares push and pull parsing).<P>

By making XMLPULL API we wanted to provide XML developers with an API that has 
familiar to SAX look and feel but is designed for pull parsing. If you would 
like to propose improvements please do not hesitate to post them to
<a href="http://www.xmlpull.org/discussion.shtml">XMLPULL discussion list</a>.<h2>
<a name="SAX2_DRIVER"></a>Is adapter for SAX2 to XMLPULL API available?</h2>

<p>Yes - the SAX2 driver that uses XMLPULL API to do XML parsing is available in
<a href="#CVS">CVS repository</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="STATUS"></a>How complete is XMLPULL API?</h2>

<P>

Current version of XMLPULL V1 API is stable and we do not plan any 
backward-incompatible changes though some additions are possible. However we 
will be <a href="http://www.xmlpull.org/discussion.shtml">discussing on 
xmlpull-dev</a> and looking forward to prepare next major release of XMLPULL API 
when there is significant need for it (and backward compatibility can not be 
maintained).


<h2><a name="API_DESIGN"></a>Why is there only one "large" interface, 
wouldn't it be cleaner to use event objects and polimorphism?</h2>

<p>On the first sight, it really seems cleaner to have event objects and
polymorphism instead of placing all the access methods in one
relatively large interface. However, while this would make the XMLPULL
API "look" somewhat nicer, a separate event object would also
introduce some issues.</p>

<p>Actually, kXML1 and XPP2 had separate event objects, and the experiences
gained there partially led to not using separate event objects in the
Common XML PULL API. The problem is that the different object types do
not have much in common. Polymorphism makes a lot of sense where an
identical set of methods can be applied to a set of different
objects. A good example may be AWT components, having common
properties and methods such as the position, size, and a paint()
method. XML start tags and an XML text events have only in common that
they are observed when parsing an XML document, they do not share a
single common property.</p>

<p>When using separate event objects, there are several additional
design options. For example, methods like getAttributeValue() make
only sense for start tags, so it seems natural to place them only
there. However, when it comes to actual access, one will require an
<samp>instanceof</samp> check and a type cast:</p>

<pre>if (parser.getEvent() instanceOf StartTag ) {
   StartTag st = (StartTag) parser.getEvent ();
   // access tag via st
}
else ...
</pre>

<p>While the overhead does not seem very large at the first sight,
please keep in mind that in many cases there is not much done
with the event, often access is as simple as a name check or
similar.</p>
 
<p>Alternatively to the previous approach, we could also use different
access methods depending on the event type, avoiding the type
cast. This would look like the next example:</p>

<pre>if ( parser.getEventType() == parser.START_TAG ) {
  StartTag st = getStartTag ();
  // access tag via st
}
else ...
</pre>

<p>Obviously, while in this case neiter an instanceof check nor
a type cast is required, this approach would add a lot of methods
to the parser, and it would be no longer significantly smaller
than the integrated interface that is now used in the XmlPull API.</p>

<p>Anothert option may be to add the access methods of 
all event types to the event base class. However, in that case 
the event object would be nearly as huge as the integrated
interface of the XmlPull API, and the API 
readability advantage would be lost.</p>

<p>Finally, the event objects are not for free. Creating lots of
objects that are used just for extracting some information to build an
application dependend structure may create significant overhead. While
this overhead may be reduced by reusing event objects, reusing event
objects is extremely dangerous since an object given to the user will
change in the background without further notice. In contrast, in the
XmlPull API it is obvious that the return values of query mehtods like
getEventType, getText() and getName() will be different after a call
to one of the next() method that advane the parser to the next
event. </p>







<h2><a name="3NEXT"></a>What is the difference between 
<tt>nextToken()</tt>, <tt>next()</tt>, <tt>nextTag()</tt>, and <tt>nextText()</tt>?</h2>

<p>All those methods have in common that they advance the parset to
a next event. </p>

<ul> 

<li><tt>nextToken()</tt> provides fine grained access to all XML events,
including "low level" events like comments and processing instructions. </li>

<li><tt>next()</tt> works similar to <tt>nextToken()</tt>, but it skips low
level events like comments and processing instructions. Text events that are
interrupted by comments or processing instructions are aggregated to a single
text event.

<li><tt>nextTag()</tt> works like <tt>next()</tt>, but also skips 
text fragments that contain only whitespace. If the next
event observed is not a start tag or end tag, an exception
is thrown.

<li><tt>nextText()</tt> has the precondition that the current event is a start
tag. It reads text until the corresponding end tag is reached and stops on the
end tag. The return value of <tt>nextText()</tt> is the text that was read. If
<tT>nextText()</tT> observes an additional start tag while parsing text, an
exception is thrown. The motivation behind this method is to provide an unique
handling for the cases "&lt;tag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt;", "&lt;tag/&gt;", and
&lt;/tag&gt;some text&lt;/tag&gt;". </li>

</ul>


<h2><a name="NEXT_MOTIV"></a>Why are there different <tt>next()</tt> methods, wouldn't it be cleaner to
have a set method, allowing me to specify the type of events I am interested in
in general?</h2>

<p>A significant advantage of pull parsers over push parsers
is that they can easily be handed over to different methods as
a parameter. Those methods can then handle their subtree. 
However, when the parser would have a lot of state options, at 
each of those hand over points it would be neccessary to
make sure that the state matches the requirements of the
subroutine. The same checks would be neccessary when the 
soubroutine returns and the original processor regains
control.</p>




<h2><a name="ROUNDTRIP"></a>Is it possible to roundtrip XML with 
XMLPULL API?</h2>

<P>
If the feature <a href="http://xmlpull.org/v1/doc/features.html#xml-roundtrip">
XML ROUNDTRIP</a> is enabled then exact round-tripping of XML 1.0 is possible as 
parser instance will make available content of XML start tag and end tag 
including white spaces. This however may not be possible for other than standard 
XML 1.0 representations of XML&nbsp;infoset (such as WBXML). But even when
<a href="http://xmlpull.org/v1/doc/features.html#xml-roundtrip">XML ROUNDTRIP</a> 
feature is false the round-tripping of all other elements can be done by use of
<a href="http://www.xmlpull.org/v1/doc/api/org/xmlpull/v1/XmlPullParser.html#nextToken()">
nextToken()</a> method instead of next().


<h2><a name="SERIALIZE"></a>How to write XML output with XMLPULL API?</h2>
<P>

This is currently not supported though one can always write custom method for it 
(one of internal JUnit tests shows an example how to round-trip XML - this is 
used to test XMLPULL API). There is work currently on xmlpull-dev mailing list 
to add XmlSerializer API.<h2>


<a name="FACTORY_ABSTRACT"></a>Why XmlPullParserFactory class is not abstract?</h2>

<p>The XmlPullParserFactory is not abstract to allow use of it. Typical XMLPULL 
V1 API implementation should provide its own factory that extends 
XmlPullParserFactory. However if implementation factory class is not created 
then default XmlPullParserFactory can be used to create parser instances by 
specifying in resource <code>/META-INF/services/org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserFactory</code>
comma separated list of names of parser classes (that must implement 
XmlPullParser interface) and/or factories (that must extend XmlPullParserFactory 
) to try. Making XmlPullParserFactory not abstract and allowing it to create 
parser instances allows to minimize size of XMLPULL implementations in J2ME 
environments - no need to write factory class as default XmlPullParserFactory&nbsp; 
can be used. Of course for really tight memory environments using constructor of 
parser implementation class may be better option therefore not needing any 
factory class.</p>

<p>Summing it up: XmlPullParserFactory has two distinct roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it is a base class that is used to create factory class for API 
  implementations (similarly to JAXP)</li>
  <li>it can be used in memory restricted environments to create parser 
  instances</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that though XmlPullParserFactory it still can be used exactly the 
same way as if it were abstract. And in this respect it works exactly like 
factories in JAXP. Moreover XMLPULL implementations should override 
XmlPullParserFactory to provide more customized and faster factories - default 
factory uses Class.forName() and therefore it may have negative impact on 
performance.</p>

<h2><a name="TYPES"></a>Why not use final method instead of TYPES array?</h2>

<P>

The problem with modifiable entries in array is that user my by mistake modify 
entry (there is no way in java to declare read-only array). However this array 
is provided only to make easier conversion of parser event types to text 
description and has no influence on parsing (in the worst parser error messages 
that uses TYPES may be affected).<P>

It looks like a method would have been nicer - and would provide read-only 
conversion. But this was the only way to put 
this functionality in the XmlPullParser interface without requiring additional 
implementation effort in the parser. The information provided in TYPES is just to make error messages better readable, the parser does not rely on 
this array in any way.
